Best Worst-Case Routing (BWR) is a novel routing approach for datacenters and inter-datacenter networks.

This paper discusses the multipath extension of the routing technique proposed in [On Minimizing the Completion Times of Long Flows over Inter-Datacenter WAN](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328008697_On_Minimizing_the_Completion_Times_of_Long_Flows_over_Inter-Datacenter_WAN).
